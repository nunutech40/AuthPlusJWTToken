# About This Auth and JWT
- i use jwt token from this repository https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth
- i use table user default that laravel created in migration

#case 1 
-  when i install tymondesigns/jwt-auth, i got error not supported for laravel 8. then i use this for installing tymondesigns/jwt-auth

$ echo composer require tymon/jwt-auth --ignore-platform-reqs

- after installation i use this documentation for setting the tymond design in my laravel project: https://jwt-auth.readthedocs.io/en/docs/laravel-installation/
